<h2>andrefernandes86/tools-malware-samples</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">This container is running scripts that download malware samples from different locations.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Some of these downloads will happen using HTTP and others using HTTPS, so if you want to detect all of them, you have to count on additional tools and features enabled (TP, DS, DD, C1WS, C1NS, A1, etc).</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">All the samples are classified into two different categories:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-size: 1.5em;"><a title="TippingPoint Samples" href="/tippingpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TippingPoint</a> - Samples to be used when demonstrating the TP capabilities. Note that each file has a Filter ID as part of its name (make sure the appropriate filter ID is enabled on TP).<br /><br /></li>
<li style="font-size: 1.5em;"><a title="Deep Discovery Samples" href="/deepdiscovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepDiscovery</a> - The samples under this directory are classified into two categories. Known-Malware and 0-Day_Malware. Make sure you are considering the impact and having the required tools in order to make each of the categories be detected.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note_1: All the time this container is destroyed/recreated, the scripts running inside will download new samples.</p>
<p>Note_2: Be careful using this container, and make sure you are using it in an isolated and secured environment, to avoid security incidents. The purpose of this container is to help testing the security features of network and agent-based security solutions.</p>
